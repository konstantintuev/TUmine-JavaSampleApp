# TUmine Monero Miner for Android - Java

# Usage

Everything is automated. The library loads the needed binary for the cpu architecture and starts mining.

# Notes
  
This app is just a colorful and inefficient UI for the [TUmine monero library](https://android-miner.tuev-co.eu).
This app's package name is already registered as paid and you will receive 95% of the mined coins.
